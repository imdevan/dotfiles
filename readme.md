# Dot files

tbh I know very little about dot file directory architecture.

`index.sh` Is the main file that all other files are included in.

### Installation

**Step 1**
Clone the repository into your root directory

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/imdevan/dotfiles.git
```

**Step 2**  
Add `source ~/dotfiles/index.sh` to the end of your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file

If you don't have a `.bashrc` file in your root directory, you can create one
and everything should work.


**Step 3**
Restart you're terminal

**Optional Step 4**
For some of the github funcationality you will have to add

```
GIT_SSH_URL=git@github.com:<your_github_username>
```

And have `ssh` setup w/ your github account.

### notes

- `vars` contains files that are used throughout
- All other files function independently of each other
- Leave an issue if you have questions or... issues
